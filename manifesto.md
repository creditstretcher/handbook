# OUR COMPANY MANIFESTO

## Business finance sucks. We make it suck less.

We are CreditStretcher. And these are the things we believe in.

These are the core values shared by everyone at CreditStretcher. Values we fight for every day.


#### Business finance sucks. We make it suck less.
* Let's be honest, who doesn't think business finance sucks? It will always suck. If our goal was to make it awesome, or breathtaking or fill in the blank platitude, we'd be lying to ourselves and our customers. Instead we strive each year to make business finance suck just a little bit less than it did the year before. Now that feels realistic.


* Everyone only wins, if nobody loses.
* Business can be a force for good.
* Honest transparency. (simple communication)
* Empathy and service.
* Knowledge sharing and education (financial literacy) (Don’t give a man a fish)
* Common sense (independent thinking)
* Human centered capitalism (Andrew Yang)
* First principles (innovative thinking, re-engineering the solution, not 5% better)
* Creative.
* Continuous learning. Move fast and figure out along the way.
* Freedom. Financial freedom. Remote company.
* Conversational customer communication
* Don’t make me think
* Intrinsic motivation. 
* Fairness (fair for everybody involved).
* Evening the playing field (factoring is difficult for SME’s. We make it easier).
* The painkiller (using disruptive innovation). Financial pain relief.
* Be in control (financial control). Financial inclusion for SMEs.
* Be different. Break the status quo. Positively.
* Small teams.
* Automization (do it once, properly. And then not have to do it again, scalability). Automating away the mundane, repetitive and allowing people to do value adding and meaningful work. 
* Data-driven decision making
