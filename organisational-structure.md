# Our Organisational Structure


# The Organisation “MACHINE” is divided into 4 Parts:

## **1. Top lvl Management:**
(N/A for now)

## **2. Organisational Management (OM)**
**The ultimate responsible parties (Co-Founders) for CreditStretcher’s success, holds the majority of shares and voting rights.**
**Responsible for:**
- Reaching and communicating Vision, Mission, Quality & Value Delivery.
- Making and overall responsibility for making sure that the execution of the Strategy happens.
- Reaching overall goals derived from the strategy.
- Set up and follow up on metrics/goals in each CM (Category Management) with the respective RP (Responsible Party).
- Fundraising.
- Setting and raising standards according to goals set and make sure the CM communicates this.
- Hold CM accountable and responsible for their Responsibilities and that they reach the goals and metrics.
- Clearance of expectations with CMs and the external environment.
- Coaching the CMs.

**Systems that OM use to stay in sync with the machine and secure execution:**
- Defined metrics that track the important produced value that makes the most progress towards our goals in each CM. There needs to be defined and written down how we expect things to go before we start executing.
- If they go as we expect, then we do well.
- If they go bad, this is our cue to investigate.
- We can only investigate if we have RPs (responsible parties)

**We NEED to set up the following for them:**
- Job definition
- Responsibility
- Clear expectation of what we expect
- Define the standards we expect.
- WE NEED to have good controls here and do checkups in order to have trust and honesty in our organisation.
- Most people will try to cheat somehow and jump over where it’s easy. We prevent this by having full transparency and access to what CMs and SDMs do so we can drill down fast if anything comes up in our or their issue logs. “No rules work if there’s no follow up by policemen”.
- “Our Happiness and success depends on good controls”

- Weekly Meeting (Wednesday 8 am - 10 pm) getting in sync and discuss execution, structure and goals. (JP, CT, LA)
- Machine meeting every 3rd Monday (CT, JP) to collectively go through the issue logs of different CMs and solve the issues that exist or be proactive (getting in sync).
- Weekly meeting with CMs separately (Meetings to get in sync with problems and align CMs with the whole organisation and diagnose if there are any problems in their respective issue logs.) 
- A meeting resume is written in every meeting: by CM)
- It's super important to write down while we speak as the things discussed will be important to our progress and problem-solving. - Nobody normally remembers what happened on a meeting unless it's written down.
