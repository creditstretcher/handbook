# Working Remotely

This section is about how we work remotely

For the reasoning behind why we choose remote work please read: [Why Remote?](https://github.com/creditstretcher/handbook/blob/master/why-remote.md)


## Communication

### Asynchronous

One of the great benefits of working remotely is that you don't get disturbed all the time as you would in an office by somebody tapping your shoulder. This is something that we value and protect. 

We try to keep as much as possible of our communication asynchronous. By asynchronous we mean a form of communication that doesn't require all the parties to be available at the same time. 
Example: Slack and Email

This also fits better with employees working in multiple timezones and varying work hours.


When you communicate asynchronous it's very important to eliminate as much as possible of the back and forth, because there can be long delays. To do this ensure that you write a thorough message that contains all the information and where you have though about if the receiving party is able to understand it.

Send the message to all the relevant parties. Use a Slack Channels as much as possible. Think about not excluding 

**We do expect a response time of maximum 24 hours**
(Note: If you're being contacted in a case of emergency, we expect you to respond immediately)

**All communication and material must be in English**

### Video calls
Some issues are just better discussed over video chat and feel free to setup meetings if you feel it's necessary.

At each meeting there must be a meeting host. The host is the one who calls the meeting and makes sure that the agenda is followed. The agenda must be prepaired and sent to all meeting participants by the host in reasonable time beforehand. The host is also responsible for notes being taken during the meeting. 

[Zoom](https://github.com/creditstretcher/handbook/blob/master/tools.md#zoom) is our video call provider of choice. 

The host will be the one setting up the time for the meeting with [calendar invites](https://github.com/creditstretcher/handbook/blob/master/tools.md#calendar) and will be the one creating the zoom meeting.

### Taking notes at meetings

Note taking is an important part of a meeting else no one will remember what was agreed upon or what was said, and instead of each person writing their own notes separately we do it collectively in a google docs document.

The host will create a google drive document inside the CreditStretcher A/S > Meeting Notes folder

The document shall follow the following naming convention:
![alt Meeting notes naming](https://github.com/creditstretcher/handbook/blob/master/assets/images/meeting-notes-naming.png?raw=true)

Inside it the host will have prepaired an agenda which will have the headlines inside the document like this:
![alt Meeting notes naming](https://github.com/creditstretcher/handbook/blob/master/assets/images/meeting-notes-agenda.png?raw=true)

Throughout the meeting everyone will participate in writing the notes in the document under the agenda headlines.
