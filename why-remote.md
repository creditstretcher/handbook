# Why remote?


## What we mean by remote
First of all let’s make clear what is meant by remote. By remote we don’t mean that we allow people to work from home every now and then, we mean that we don’t require employees to come into the office at all. It means that you can work from anywhere in the world no matter if it’s your home or a sandy beach on a pacific island, as long as you’re able to be productive (we trust you).

For the time being we have an office in Fintech Lab Copenhagen, which serves as the base of operations. It has nice facilities with meeting rooms, coffee machine and even a boat to sail through the canals. Everyone is welcome there if they see fit.

## Why we choose remote
* You’re able to hire talent from all over the world
* More productive employees because of fewer distractions while working
* Cost savings on Offices
* Attracts self motivated people
* Significant benefit to offer employees
* [Lower turnover](https://www.owllabs.com/blog/remote-work-statistics) because of happy employees and people never quit because they have to move to another city 
* Easier to scale the company

## Why remote is good for you
* You don’t spend a lot of time commuting
* You save money on food and can often keep a healthier diet, when you don’t can to grab something quick during your lunch hour
* You’re able to travel without taking vacation
* You can setup your own environment to be the most productive
* You choose your own working hours
* Do you want to take a midday run or go to the gym. Go for it!

## Challenges
* Social cohesion, but we are all in this together and we do everything we can to keep the company culture and the team spirit high! 
* Employee can feel lonely especially in the beginning
* The onboarding of new employees is typically more difficult and requires more self-learning of the individual
* Communication in the company. Here everybody has to put in some effort to communicate what is important
* Requires the individual to be self-motivated, disciplined, and organized
