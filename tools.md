# Tools
This is a list of the tools that we use and a quick introduction to them as well.
## Calendar
The host of a meeting is responsible for sending out calendar invites to attendees by email.
The calendar invite shall include the correct time, specify location (if physical location) or if it will be on Zoom (if the meeting is a video call) and an agenda in the notes. 
Go here to see how we conduct [video calls](https://github.com/creditstretcher/handbook/blob/master/working-remotely.md#video-calls).
## Slack
We use Slack for chat and overall coommunication within the company.
### Channels
List and purpose
- #general
  - This channel is for workspace-wide communication and announcements. All members are in this channel.
- #random
  - A place for non-work-related flimflam, faffing, hodge-podge or jibber-jabber you'd prefer to keep out of more focused work-related channels. 
  - The purpose of this is to create social cohesion within our team, therefore we encourage everyone to use it.
  - Because we are a remote company we don't see each other every day, and this is to act as the daily watercooler talk

## Zoom 
We use zoom as our default video call tool because simply it does the job in everything from small one on one meetings to large meetings. 

The important thing is that everyone use the same tool so we don't waste time agreeing upon and installing various video call tools. 

Sign up at the [Zoom website](https://zoom.us/) and remember to use your creditstretcher email.

## Wickr
For sharing of sensitive data like passwords or certificates we use Wickr. In general it should be used for things that you would like to share with your colleagues but you know is sensitive.

### Why Wickr
Wickr is a military grade end to end encrypted instant communication tool where you can set the messages to be deleted after e.g. 24 hours. That way it is highly secure to send data here.

### How to set it up
Ask David MÃ¸ller for an invite and follow the instructions (takes 10 min)
