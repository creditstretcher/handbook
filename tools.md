# Tools
This is a list of the tools that we use and a quick introduction to them as well.
## Calendar

The calendar invite shall include the correct time, specify location (if physical location) or if it will be on Zoom (if the meeting is a video call) and an agenda in the notes.

## Zoom 
We use zoom as our default video call tool because simply it does the job in everything from small one on one meetings to large meetings. 

The important thing is that everyone use the same tool so we don't waste time agreeing upon and installing various video call tools. 

Sign up at the [Zoom website](https://zoom.us/) and remember to use your creditstretcher email.

Go here to see how we conduct [video calls](https://github.com/creditstretcher/handbook/blob/master/working-remotely.md#video-calls).
