# Where we work


## Office
The CreditStretcher HQ is in Copenhagen. But everybody works from home regularly. In fact, some of our employees have never visited the office. Everyone is welcome to visit the HQ whenever they like.

## From home
Most of our employees work from home. In fact, we encourage this. Because, at home, you can create your own unique space that works for you. No distractions. No one asking stupid questions in the middle of an important task. Just you and your own space getting on with the work.

## From coffee shops
If you're sick of staring at the same four walls all day - get out and go to a local coffee shop. Other people working around you can be a great motivator. When working from a coffee shop, please take security precautions such as using a VPN and putting your laptop somewhere safe while you visit the toilet.

## From a coworking space
If you don't want to work at home or from a coffee shop, we're happy for you to work from a coworking space. You can find the best around by using Workfrom (who are offering CreditStretcher employees a discount to their community - ask  Joseph Pack ü¶ì Joseph  for more details).


## That's all great, but why remote working?

There are major working benefits to working remotely...

- Very few meetings. If there are any, they have the fewest people possible involved, usually a max of 2‚Äì3.
- No commute. Why spend 30‚Äì60 minutes traveling to some random building in a busy area to work when we can do the same work at home? This easily saves 10 hours a week per employee!
- We don‚Äôt chat all day. There‚Äôs zero expectation of keeping on top of every chat or responding to an IM immediately. In fact, we encourage you to close everything communications-related so that you can focus on the actual work at hand.
- We don‚Äôt all work 9 to 5. We work hours that fit our life and brains. If, for example, you‚Äôre sharpest at 6 am, why the hell would you wait until ‚Äúnormal business hours‚Äù to start working? That‚Äôs a waste of your best brainpower! As long as we overlap a few hours with our team, we work when it makes sense, not by some arbitrary clock time.

On top of the working benefits we believe that the following reasons make for a much happier and healthier personal life, too.

## While working remotely, you can...

- Hug your kids and feed them breakfast before they leave for school in the morning.
- Greet and make a snack for them when they get home; hear all about their day.
- Work from your favourite coffee shop.
- Go on retreats and company meetups (last year was Singapore!!)
- Spend a week with the team in sunny Singapore (while it‚Äôs freezing in Copenhagen).
- Run an errand for a friend.
- Walk your dogs.
- Work with a friend.
- Care for a sick child without taking a sick day.
- Focus without interruption.
- Set your own schedule.
- Do yoga in the middle of the day to set yourself up for a great working afternoon.
